        <section name="Dependency information">

            <p>
                Excalibur is built using maven. Information about the dependencies of a particular
                subproject can be retrieved from the project.xml file of that subproject. To retrieve
                a complete list of all dependencies, we've written a small script:
            </p>

            <pre>
                cd ~/svn/asf/excalibur/trunk/site
                ruby scripts/aggregate-dependencies.rb
            </pre>

            <p>
                Should result in a file <code>project-all-deps.xml</code> which is a maven project.xml
                file with a list of all the excalibur dependencies.</p>

        </section>
