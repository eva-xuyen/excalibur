        <section name="Excalibur Event (DEPRECATED)">
            <p>
                This package has been deprecated. See
                <a href="deprecated.html">this page</a> for more
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
        This is the Excalibur Event package which includes event queues,
        asynchronous command processing, and the interfaces to support
        event based programming.  Event is heavily influenced by Matt
        Welsh's work with the
                <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/" target="_new">
        SEDA architecture</a>.
        We forked the portion of his SandStorm server that had to do with
        event processing.  From there we cleaned up the API and made it as
        generic as we could.
            </p>
            <p>
        The Event package actually has five related sub packages inside
        of it.  Event is the basic interfaces for the Queues, Sinks,
        Sources, etc.  Command houses code for the CommandManager so that
        your code can safely process Commands (a type of event) in the
        background.  MPool, short for Managed Pool, houses code for a
        pool implementation that manages its size asynchronously so you
        don't have to worry about it.  Lastly, Util provides some basic
        utilities so that we can programatically determine the number
        of processors your hardware has.
