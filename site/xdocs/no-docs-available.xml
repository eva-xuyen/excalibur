            <p>
                Excalibur contains a lot of components that have no significant
                amount of documentation besides their javadocs. In order to
                reduce maintainance overhead and be able to focus on the things
                we deem most important, we have decided to stop actively
                maintaining those documentation sets.
            </p>

                You have reached this page because you have tried to acces such
                a set of obsolete documentation. The javadocs for all excalibur
                packages can be found at

                I think everyone agrees that the absence of documentation for
                the component you're interested in is a bit of a shame. We are
                looking for volunteers to write this documentation. If you're
                interested in helping out, please drop by on the Avalon
                Development mailing list

                (<a href="/mail-lists.html">Subscription information</a>)

                for more information on how to do just that.
