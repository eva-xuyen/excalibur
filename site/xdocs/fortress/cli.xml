            <p>
        Command Line Tools are the class of tools or applications that are
        run from a command shell.  Typical examples are the ANT build tool,
        Turbine Maven, Apache Forrest, etc.  They have a definite begining
        and a definite end.  As a result, we don't have to do any trickery
        with threads or synchronizing the startup and shutdown of the
        container.
            </p>
            <p>
        A typical example of creating a Fortress CLI application will follow
        the pattern outlined below:
            </p>
            <!--      <source>
                    <![CDATA[
            public int main(String [] args)
            {
                // You would have to implement the referenced method here...
                FortressConfig config = configWithArgs( args );
                ContainerManager cm = new DefaultContainerManager( config.getContext() );
                ContainerUtil.initialize( cm );

                // Get the root container and use it
                MyCLIContainer container = (MyCLIContainer) cm.getContainer();
                container.performAction(args);

                // Clean up after ourselves
                ContainerUtil.dispose( cm );
            }
                    ]]>
                  </source>-->
            <p>
        As you can see, there are three major portions of working with
        Fortress: startup, useage, and shutdown;  The Startup and shutdown
        portions are not likely to change at all.  What will change is how
        you plan on interacting with your container.
