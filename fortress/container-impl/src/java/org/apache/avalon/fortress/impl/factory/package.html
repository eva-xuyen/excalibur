  ObjectFactory wrappers to provide proxied components to the container.
</p>
<h1>Proxy Factories</h1>
<p>
  There are currently two types of factories available with Fortress: BCEL
  enabled, and traditional JDK 1.3 proxies.
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">Jakarta BCEL</a> is a library to
  directly generate Java class bytecode.  You do not have to include this
  library for Fortress to function, however if it is present Fortress will
  use it.
</p>
<h2>The Need</h3>
<p>
  Proxies are used both for the protection of the component's lifecycle methods,
  and for backwards compatibility with Composable components.  The proxy
  automatically adds the <code>Component</code> interface to any component (even
  if it did not have it in the source code) so that it can be used with your
  old legacy components.  As everyone upgrades, the backwards compatibility
  concern becomes less of an issue--however protecting a component is still
  very important.
</p>
<h2>JDK 1.3 Proxy Code</h2>
<p>
  The Java Proxy code uses reflection to do its dirty work, so despite all the
  advances in JDK 1.4 introspection code you will still incur a substantial
  performance bottleneck using this approach.  A user did a micro-benchmark
  and reported that the performance hit is around 4:1 vs. just using the component
  directly.  If your components are not repeatedly called several times in rapid
  succession as is the case with micro-benchmarks then you probably will barely
  notice the change.  Nevertheless, in some environments (most notably when you
  are working with Servlets) that performance hit will begin to add up.
</p>
<h2>BCEL Enabled Proxy Code</h2>
<p>
  The BCEL enabled proxy code creates a wrapper class that directly calls the
  methods on your component as if you wrote it yourself.  As an example, the
  following two code snippets will show you how the component is proxied:
</p>
<h3>Component's Interface</h3>
<pre>
public interface HelloWorldComponent
{
    String sayHello();
}
</pre>
<h3>Wrapper Class</h3>
<pre>
public final class HelloWorldComponent$BCELWrapper
{
    private final HelloWorldComponent m_component;

    public HelloWorldComponent$BCELWrapper(HelloWorldComponent base)
    {
        m_component = base;
    }

    public String sayHello()
    {
        return m_component.sayHello();
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>The Benefit</h3>
<p>
  The resulting code is much easier for the JVM to use, and does not pose a
  serious threat to the performance of the component.  All you have to do is
  include the BCEL.jar file, and the choice will be made for you.
</p>
