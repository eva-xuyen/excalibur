            <p>
                Excalibur is organised very modularly, as you would expect
                from a component-oriented project. Containerkit contains
                several standalone libraries which are used to build our
                containers, and potentially those of external projects.
            </p><p>
                If you are not building or customizing your own container, your
                use for these libraries will probably be somewhat limited.

                            Excalibur Instrument is an instrumentation utility that allows you
                            to attach a separate JVM to your running application to determine its
                            health.  Instrumentation is the process of exposing the internal state
                            in a way that is easy for an administrator or help desk personell to
                            digest.  Excalibur Instrumentation is such a package that you can use
                            for your Avalon based projects.

                            specifying a 'logger' attribute which denotes the log category
