    <subsection name="Recursion Introduction">
      <p>
        Use the same interface for communication with components of
        the same type.  It allows the swapping of those components
        for other components of the same type without breaking existing
        code.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need additional functionality, either create proxy
        objects that implement the interface, or add it by subclassing
        (hence the name "Recursion Introduction").  Even if
        there is no recursion happening, it appears to operate in the
        same manner.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Eliminate Case Analysis">
      <p>
        Avoid testing to see if an object is an instance of a particular
        class.  Usually, if you think you need that approach then a
        redesign will help immensely.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Reduce the Number of Arguments">
      <p>
        Methods with a half-dozen arguments are hard to read, and can
        usually be accomplished with an object that represents that
        set of arguments.  It also makes it easier to track down the
        problems.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Reduce the Size of Methods">
      <p>
        Most of your methods should only need to be a few lines long.
        Methods that are very long (like 50 lines or so) are too complex,
        and should be considered guilty of bad design until proven
        innocent.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="The Top of the Class Hierarchy Should be Abstract">
      <p>
        In many cases it is beneficial to provide an abstract base class 
        to extend for your specializations.  The majority of the 
        functionality and behavior is well defined. This makes it easier
        to decipher what the intents of the interface designer were.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Minimize Accesses to Variables">
      <p>
        This point formalizes the principles of data hiding.  Try not
        to expose class attributes to other classes, but protect them
        by methods.  If an attribute changes name, then you only have
        one place to update the code instead of hundreds.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Subclasses Should be Specializations">
      <p>
        A [subclass] "is a" [superclass].  If what you
        are trying to do is make a Component into a ComponentManager,
        then you are violating the spirit of the framework.  A better
        approach is to use containment in that case (i.e. a [class]
        "has a" [external class]).
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Split Large Classes">
      <p>
        If a class has 50+ methods, then it is most likely trying to
        do too much.  Look at separating the functionality into
        separate components.  Like methods that are too long, classes
        that violate this rule should be considered guilty of wrong
        design until proven innocent.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Factor Implementation Differences Into Subcomponents">
      <p>
        If a subclass implements a method completely different from
        the superclass, then it is not really a specialization.  It
        should be split off from that class hierarchy tree.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Separate Methods that Do Not Communicate">
      <p>
        Sometimes in building a framework you run into a case where
        you have different views of the same data.  In these cases,
        you can have some attributes that describe how to generate
        the data, and some attributes that describe the data itself.
        It is better to separate these two views into separate classes.
        The semantics are different enough to justify this solution.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Send Messages to Components instead of to This">
      <p>
        The point of this point is that you want to build your framework
        based on components, and not inheritance.  Avalon takes this
        point to heart.  In order to illustrate, I will give two examples
        of the same thing.  The scenario is that we have a data structure
        that we want to output to an arbitrary format.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following example, we will use the Java <code>this</code>
        object and an inheritance based framework.  As you can see, this
        would be a bear to maintain, and it won't easily be extended.
      </p>
      <source>
abstract class AbstractExampleDocument 
{
  // skip some code ...
public void output(Example structure) 
{
    if( null != structure )
    {
      this.format( structure );
    }
}

  protected void format(Example structure);
}
      </source>
      <p>
        In the next example, we will use the Avalon component based
        architecture.  There is a clean separation between the purpose
        of the objects, and you can exchange and extend formatting
        without worrying about any other concerns.
      </p>
      <source>
class DefaultExampleDocument 
{
// skip some code ...
public void output(Example structure) 
{
   ExampleFormatter formatter = 
     (ExampleFormatter) manager.lookup(Roles.FORMATTER);
   if( null != structure ) 
   {
     formatter.format(structure);
   }
}
}
      </source>
      <p>
        An inheritance based framework (White Box) can be converted
        into a component based framework (Black Box) structure by
        replacing overridden methods with method calls (message sends)
        to components.  Component based architecture is much more
        flexible in this regard.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Eliminate Implicit Parameter Passing">
      <p>
        Just because two methods share the same information within the
        class does not mean that it should be done in that manner.
        Many times, the attribute that is shared should be passed
        as a parameter of the method instead of directly accessing
        the attribute.
