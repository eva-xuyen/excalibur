    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>
        Apache Excalibur hosts the Apache Avalon Framework.  The documentation
        in this section has been taken from the original Avalon site and has not
        been updated to reflect recent changes.  Please feel free to submit patches
        and improvements to the Excalibur developer team.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Avalon Framework consists of interfaces
        that define relationships between commonly used application components,
        best-of-practice pattern enforcements, and several
        lightweight convenience implementations of the generic components.
      </p>
