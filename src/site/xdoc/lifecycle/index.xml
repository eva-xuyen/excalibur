            <p>
        The Lifecycle package contains a set of interfaces and classes 
        supporting portable lifecycle extensions.
            </p>

            <p>
        Contributions to this project are based on co-development actives by
        container projects aiming towards cross-container component portability 
        and consistent service management.
            </p>

            <p>
        The first step in the container project has been undertaken between the
        Fortress and Merlin containers on the subject of lifestyle extension 
        support. The original design and implementation of lifecycle extensions 
        by Marcus Crafter was implemented using the Fortress container.  
        Subsequently, and alternative implementation based on Marcus' design was
        introduced using the Merlin container leading to two incompatible 
        solutions aiming at the same objective.  Through a process of 
        cross-project collaboration, the Fortress and Merlin developers reached
        consensus on a common set of APIs and abstract implementation. These 
        resources constitute the first sub-project of the Excalibur Container 
        package.
