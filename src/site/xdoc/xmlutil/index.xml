            <p>
          The XMLUtil package provides some useful components dealing with
          XML, like a parser (for DOM and SAX), an XSLT processor and an
          XPath processor.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, some useful classes and interfaces for XML handling
              (mostly SAX events) are provided as well.
            </p>
            <p>
        The original version of this package has been donated by the
                <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Apache Cocoon project</a>.
