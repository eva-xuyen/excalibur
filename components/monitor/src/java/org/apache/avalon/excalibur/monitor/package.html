    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <code>org.apache.avalon.excalibur.monitor</code> package contains interfaces and classes
    for resource monitoring. The design is sufficiently modular to allow for different implementations of the
    monitoring strategies, and resource types.  A FileResource is included for your convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to receive notification that a resource has been modified, you must implement the
      <code>java.beans.PropertyChangeListener</code> interface.  You will be notified with a
      <code>java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent</code> where the property name is "last-modified".
      Because the PropertyChangeEvent works with Objects, you must recast the Object returned
      into a <code>java.lang.Long</code> object.  From there you can derive the previously modified
      time as well as the current modified time.
